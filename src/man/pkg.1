.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the client for the Image Packaging System.
With a valid configuration,
.Nm
can be invoked to create locations for packages to be installed, called images,
and install packages into those images.
Packages are published by publishers, who can make their packages available at
one or more repositories, or in package archives.
.Nm
retrieves packages from a publisher\&'s repository or package archives and
installs the packages into an image.
.Pp
Packages can only be installed into file systems that are part of a
boot environment (BE).
For example, on a default OmniOS installation, only datasets under
.Pa rpool/ROOT/ Ns Ar BEname Ns /
are supported for package operations.
.Pp
A publisher name identifies a person, group of persons, or an organization as
the source of one or more packages.
To avoid publisher name collisions and help identify the publisher, a best
practice is to use a domain name that represents the entity publishing the
packages as a publisher name.
.Pp
A repository is a location where clients can publish and retrieve package
content (files contained within the package such as programs and documents) and
metadata (information about the package such as its name and description).
As an example, a publisher named
.Sy example.org
might have their repository located at the URI
.Sy http://example.org/repository .
.Pp
.Nm
can also uninstall packages, refresh publisher metadata (such as the list of
available packages), validate package installation in an image, and query the
image for various tokens.
These queries can also be made of
.Xr pkg 7 .
.Pp
Images can be of three types: full images, capable of providing a complete
system; partial images, which are linked to a full image (parent image), but do
not provide a complete system on their own; and user images.
.\"
.Sh OPTIONS
The following global options are supported:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl ? | Fl \-help
Display a usage message.
.It Fl R Ar dir
Operate on the image rooted at
.Ar dir .
If no directory was specified or determined based on environment, the default
is
.Sq Pa / .
See the
.Sx Environment Variables
section for more information.
.El
.\"
.Sh SUB-COMMANDS
.\" refresh
.Nm
.Cm refresh

.Bd -ragged -offset Ds
Update the client's list of available packages and publisher metadata for all
publishers.
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar publisher
Update the client's list of available packages and publisher metadata only
for the specified publishers.
.It Fl q
Hide progress messages during the requested operation.
.It Fl \-full
Force a full retrieval of all publisher metadata, instead of attempting an
incremental update, and request that any proxies used during the operation
ignore cached data.
This option exists for troubleshooting purposes and should not be used on a
regular basis.

.Bd -ragged -offset Ds
Install and update the specified packages to the newest version that match
.Ar pkg_fmri_pattern
allowed by the packages installed in the image.
To explicitly request the latest version of a package, use
.Cm latest
for the version portion of
.Ar pkg_fmri_pattern .
For example, specify
.Cm vim@latest .
The
.Ar pkg_fmri_pattern
pattern can include the
.Sy \&?
and
.Sy *
characters as
.Xr glob 3C Ns -style
wildcards to match one or more packages.
.Pp
Versions older or newer than what is already installed can be specified to
perform in-place downgrades or upgrades of specific packages.
Updating specific packages across package rename or obsolete boundaries is not
supported.
.Pp
Any preserved configuration files that are part of packages to be downgraded
and that have been changed since the original version was installed are renamed
using the extension
.Pa .update .
For more information about how the package system determines which files to
preserve, and how these files are preserved during package upgrades, see "File
Actions" in the
.Xr pkg 7
man page.
.Pp
Packages are selected based on publisher search order and stickiness.
See the
.Nm
.Cm publisher
and
.Nm
.Cm set-publisher
commands for information about search order and stickiness.
If the
.Ar pkg_fmri_pattern
does not specify the publisher, the first publisher that provides a matching
package is used as the installation source.
If that publisher does not provide a version of the package that can be
installed in this image, then the installation operation fails.
Use the
.Nm
.Cm list Fl a
command to see which publishers provide a version of the package that can be
installed in this image.
.Pp
If more than one
.Ar pkg_fmri_pattern
is specified, and if any of the specified packages cannot be installed in this
image, then none of the specified packages will be installed.
.Pp
Some configuration files might be renamed or replaced during the installation
process.
For more information about how the package system determines which files to
preserve, and how they are preserved during package operations, see "File
Actions" in the
.Xr pkg 7
man page.
.Pp
If a package is on the avoid list, installing it removes it from that list.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C Ar n
Specify the number of child images to update in parallel.
When recursing into child images
.Po usually installed
.Sy lipkg ,
.Sy sparse
or
.Sy pkgsrc
branded non-global zones
.Pc ,
update at most
.Ar n
child images in parallel.
The default number of child images to update in parallel is
.Sy 1 .
If
.Ar n
is 0 or a negative number, all child images are updated in parallel.
See also
.Ev PKG_CONCURRENCY
in the
.Sx Environment Variables
section and
.Sy recursion-concurrency
in the
.Sx Image Properties
section.
.It Fl g Ar path_or_uri
Temporarily add the specified package repository or archive to the list of
sources in the image from which to retrieve package data.
Repositories that require a client SSL certificate cannot be used with this
option.
This option can be specified multiple times.
.Pp
When deciding which version of a package to use, publishers configured in the
image, but not found in the specified
.Ar path_or_uri
sources, take precedence.
If the version of the package to be installed is provided by a publisher
configured in the image and by a
.Ar path_or_uri
source, the client retrieves the content for that package from the
.Ar path_or_uri
sources.
After installation or update, any packages provided by publishers not
configured in the image are added to the image configuration without an origin.
Use the
.Nm
.Cm publisher
command to see which publishers are configured in the image.
.It Fl n
Perform a trial run of the operation with no package changes made.
.It Fl q
Hide progress messages during the requested operation.
.It Fl r
Run this operation in the global zone and also in all installed linked
non-global zones.
The effect on the non-global zone is similar to logging into each non-global
zone and running the command directly.
Without this option, when you run
.Nm
commands in the global zone, non-global zones are modified only to the extent
required to keep them compatible with the global zone.
With this option, the
.Nm
operation is applied to all installed non-global zones except as limited by the
.Fl z
and
.Fl Z
options.
Zones that are excluded by the
.Fl z
and
.Fl Z
options might still be modified if updates are required to keep them in sync
with the global zone.
.It Fl z Ar zonename
Run this operation only in the specified non-global zone.
The
.Fl z
option can be specified multiple times.
The
.Fl z
option can only be used with the
.Fl r
option.
The
.Fl z
option cannot be used with the
.Fl Z
option.
.It Fl Z Ar zonename
Run this operation in all non-global zones except for the specified zone.
The
.Fl Z
option can be specified multiple times.
The
.Fl Z
option can only be used with the
.Fl r
option.
The
.Fl Z
option cannot be used with the
.Fl z
option.
.It Fl v
Issue verbose progress messages during the requested operation, and display
detailed planning information (such as changing facets, mediators, and
variants).
.Pp
This option can be specified multiple times to increase the amount of planning
information displayed.
In particular, specifying this option twice in conjunction with the
.Cm install
or
.Cm update
sub-command, results in more detailed information about why that sub-command
cannot install or update the specified packages.
.It Fl \-accept
Indicate that you agree to and accept the terms of the licenses of the packages
that are updated or installed.
If you do not provide this option, and any package licenses require acceptance,
the installation operation fails.
.It Fl \-licenses
Display all of the licences for the packages that are installed or updated as
part of this operation.
For updated packages, display the licence only if the licence has changed.
.It Fl \-no-index
Do not update the search indexes after the operation has completed successfully.
.It Fl \-no-refresh
Do not attempt to contact the repositories for the image\&'s publishers to
retrieve the newest list of available packages and other metadata.
.It Fl \-no-be-activate
If a boot environment is created, do not set it as the active boot environment
on the next boot.
See the
.Xr beadm 8
man page for more information.
.It Fl t | Fl \-temp-be-activate
If a boot environment is created, set it as the active boot environment for the
next boot only (temporary activation).
See the
.Xr beadm 8
man page for more information.
This is particularly useful for hosted environments where console access is not
readily available.
If the new boot environment boots successfully, it can be activated using
.Xr beadm 8
and, if not, a power cycle will automatically revert to the previous boot
environment.
Temporary activation can be enabled by default for updates to an image via the
.Sy temp-be-activation
package property; if this is set then it is not necessary to specify the
.Fl \-temp-be-activate
option manually.
.It Fl \-no-backup-be
Do not create a backup boot environment.
.It Fl \-require-backup-be
Always create a backup boot environment if a new boot environment will not be
created.
Without this option, a backup boot environment is created based on image
policy.
See
.Sy be-policy
in
.Sx Image Properties
below for an explanation of when backup boot environments are created
automatically.
.It Fl \-backup-be-name Ar name
Name the created backup boot environment using the given argument.
Use of
.Fl -backup-be-name
implies
.Fl -require-backup-be .
See also the

man page.
.It Fl \-deny-new-be
Do not create a new boot environment.
This operation will fail if this option is specified and the operation requires
a new boot environment.
.It Fl \-require-new-be
Always create a new boot environment.
Without this option, a boot environment is created based on image policy.
See
.Sy be-policy

.Sx Image Properties
below for an explanation of when boot environments are created automatically.
This option cannot be combined with
.Fl \-require-backup-be .
.It Fl \-be-name Ar name
Rename the newly created boot environment to be the argument given.
Use of

.It Fl \-reject Ar pkg_fmri_pattern
Prevent packages with names matching the given pattern from being installed.
If matching packages are already installed, they are removed as part of this
operation.
Rejected packages that are the target of group dependencies are placed on the
avoid list.
This option can be specified multiple times.
.It Fl \-sync-actuators
Run SMF actuators synchronously.
The
.Nm
command will not return until all SMF actuators have finished in the zone in
which
.Nm

Install or update the specified packages as if installing onto a bare system.
Any previously installed packages that are not specified on the command line
and are not a dependency of the specified packages will be removed.
This command ignores restrictions to not install packages that are on the avoid
list and not update packages that are on the frozen list.
Otherwise, this
.Cm exact-install
subcommand behaves the same way that the
.Cm install
subcommand behaves.
To explicitly request the latest version of a package, use
.Cm latest
for the version portion of
.Ar pkg_fmri_pattern .
For example, specify
.Cm vim@latest .
.Pp
Packages are selected based on publisher search order and stickiness.
See the
.Nm
.Cm publisher
and
.Nm
.Cm set-publisher
commands for information about search order and stickiness.
If the
.Ar pkg_fmri_pattern
does not specify the publisher, the first publisher that provides a matching
package is used as the installation source.
If that publisher does not provide a version of the package that can be
installed in this image, then the installation operation fails.
Use the
.Nm
.Cm list Fl a
command to see which publishers provide a version of the package that can be
installed in this image.
.Pp
If more than one
.Ar pkg_fmri_pattern
is specified, and if any of the specified packages cannot be installed in this
image, then none of the specified packages will be installed.
.Pp
Some configuration files might be renamed or replaced during the installation
process.
For more information about how the package system determines which files to
preserve, and how they are preserved during package operations, see "File
Actions" in the

Perform the search and display information about the matching actions.
This is the default.
.It Fl f
Show all results, regardless of package version.
By default,
.Cm search
prunes results from packages older than the currently installed version and
from package versions excluded by current incorporations.
.It Fl l
Search the image's installed packages.
.Pp
Both
.Fl l
and
.Fl r
.Pq or Fl s
can be specified together, in which case both local and remote searches are
performed.
.It Fl o Ar attribute
Specify the columns to include in the output.
The
.Fl o
option can be specified multiple times, or multiple attributes can be specified
as the argument to one
.Fl o
option by separating the attribute names with commas.
In addition to the pseudo attributes outlined above, the following attributes
are defined for search results.
These attributes help show why a particular result was a match:
.Bl -tag -width 1
.It search.match
The string that matched the search query.
.It search.match_type
The attribute that contained the string that matched the search query.
.El
.It Fl p
Display packages that have some actions that match each query term.
Using this option is equivalent to putting angle brackets
.Pq Aq \&
around each term in the query.
See
.Ar query
below for more description of the
.Aq \&
operator.
.It Fl r
Search the repositories corresponding to the image's publishers.
This is the default.
.Pp
Both
.Fl l
and
.Fl r
.Pq or Fl s
can be specified together, in which case both local and remote searches are
performed.
.It Fl s Ar repo_uri
Search the
.Nm
repository located at the given URI.
This can be specified multiple times.
Package archives are not supported.
.It Ar query
By default,
.Ar query
is interpreted as a series of terms to be matched exactly and multiple terms
are ANDed.
.Pp
AND and OR are supported.
.Pp
The
.Sy \&?
and
.Sy \&*
characters can be used as
.Xr glob 3C Ns -
style wildcards, allowing more flexible query matches.
.Pp
In addition to simple token matching and wildcard search, a more complicated
query language is supported.
Phrases can be searched for by using single or double quotation marks
.Pq Sy \&' No or Sy \(dq .
Be sure to take your shell into account so that
.Nm
actually sees these characters.
.Pp
Which tokens are indexed is action-dependent, but can include content hashes
and path names.
For information about actions and their attributes, see "Actions" in the
.Xr pkg 7
man page.
See also the list of pseudo attribute names in
.Nm
.Cm contents
and
.Fl o
above.
.Pp
Structured queries are supported with the following syntax:
.Sm off
.Pp
.D1 Ar pkg_name : Ar action_name : Ar index : Ar token
.Pp
.Sm on
The value of
.Ar action_name
is one of the actions listed in "Actions" in the
.Xr pkg 7
man page.
The
.Ar index
is an attribute of the action.
The value of
.Ar index
must match
.Ar token .
.Pp
Not all action attributes are searchable.
For example,
.Sy mode
is an attribute of the
.Sy file
action, but
.Sy mode
is not a valid value for
.Ar index .
.Pp
Some values for
.Ar index
are not action attributes but are values derived from other attributes.
For example,
.Ar index
can be
.Sy basename ,
which is not an attribute of any action but is derived from the
.Sy path
attribute of the
.Sy file
or
.Sy dir
action by taking the last component of the path.
.Pp
Different action types have different valid values for
.Ar index .
This documentation does not list all possible values.
Some of the more useful
.Ar index
values are
.Sy basename
and
.Sy path
for file system actions, the dependency type
.Pq for example, Sy require , Sy optional , Sy group
for
.Sy depend
actions, and
.Sy driver_name
and
.Sy alias
for
.Sy driver
actions.
.Pp
One special value for
.Ar index
is the value of a
.Sy name
attribute for a
.Sy set
action.
In this case,
.Ar token
is matched against the value of the
.Sy value
attribute that corresponds to the specified
.Sy name
attribute.
For example, the following search finds packages that are classified as either
Development/Databases or System/Databases.
In the
.Sx Examples
section, see the example of finding SMF services.
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
$ pkg search info.classification:databases
.Ed
.Pp
Missing fields in a structured query are implicitly wildcarded.
A search for
.Sy basename:pkg
matches all actions in all packages that have an
.Ar index
of
.Sy basename
and that match the
.Ar token
pkg, as shown in the following partial output:
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
$ pkg search basename:pkg
INDEX    ACTION VALUE         PACKAGE
basename dir    usr/share/pkg pkg:/package/pkg@0.5.11
basename dir    var/sadm/pkg  pkg:/package/svr4@0.5.11
basename dir    var/spool/pkg pkg:/package/svr4@0.5.11
basename file   usr/bin/pkg   pkg:/package/pkg@0.5.11
.Ed
.Pp
Adding another field narrows the search, as shown in the following complete
output:
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
$ pkg search file:basename:pkg
INDEX    ACTION VALUE       PACKAGE
basename file   usr/bin/pkg pkg:/package/pkg@0.5.11
.Ed
.Pp
Explicit wildcards are supported in the
.Ar pkg_name
and
.Ar token
fields.
The
.Ar action_name
and
.Ar index
must match exactly.
.Pp
See the
.Sx Examples
section for examples of searching for files and dependencies.
.Pp
To convert actions to the packages that contain those actions, use
.Aq \& ,
as shown in the following partial output:
.Bd -literal -offset xxxx
$ pkg search \e<pkg\e>
PACKAGE                             PUBLISHER
pkg:/package/pkg@0.5.11-151036.0    omnios
pkg:/package/svr4@0.5.11-151036.0   omnios
.Ed
.Pp
With the
.Fl a
option (and by default), searching for
.Sy token
results in information about the actions that match
.Sy token ,
while searching for
.Aq token
results in a list of packages that contain actions that match
.Sy token .

originally installed from this publisher.
.It Fl \-proxy Ar proxy_to_use
Use the specified proxy URI to retrieve content for the specified origin (
.Pq Fl g
or mirror
.Pq Fl m .
The proxy value is stored as part of the publisher configuration, which means
the system repository used by child images is automatically updated.
This option cannot be used to set an authenticated proxy.
The
.Ar proxy_to_use
value cannot have the form
.Sy protocol://user:password@host .
.Pp
At run time,
.Ev http_proxy
or related environment variables override this proxy setting.
See the "Environment" section of the

man page for the list of accepted environment variable names.
If you use an environment variable to set the proxy URI, you must also set the
appropriate proxy property of the
.Sy svc:/application/pkg/system-repository
SMF service to the same value.
.It Fl \-remove-property-value
Remove a value from an existing publisher property.
.It Fl \-reset-uuid
Choose a new unique identifier that identifies this image to its publisher.
.It Fl \-revoke-ca-cert Ar CA_hash
For verifying signed packages, treat the certificate with the given hash of its
PEM representation as revoked.
The hashes of the user-revoked CA certificates are listed in the detailed

.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm auto-be-name
.Pq string
A template to be used for building a name for a new boot environment if one is
required as a result of an update.
Without this property being set, and assuming that the
.Fl \-be-name
option is not provided, the new BE will be named after the current, with an
incrementing numerical suffix.
If an update requires a new boot environment but is not associated with an
OmniOS release then the template will not be used.
The

.Sy IYYYYMMDD
.It Cm \&%r
The release being installed, without the leading
.Sy r -
e.g.
.Sy 151026c
.It Cm time : Ns Ar format
The current date and time in the format specified.
.Ar format
is a

compatible string such as
.Sy omnios-%Y.%m.%d .
It is not advised to use hyphens for separating components as the trailing
component may be confused with a boot environment revision number.
.El
.Pp
The default value for the
.Cm auto-be-name
property is
.Dq Sy omnios-r%r .
.It Cm be-policy
.Pq string
Specify when a boot environment is created during packaging operations.
The following values are allowed:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm default
Apply the default boot environment creation policy,
.Cm create-backup .
.It Cm always-new
Requires a reboot for all package operations by performing them in a new boot
environment set as active on the next boot.
A backup boot environment is not created unless explicitly requested.
.Pp
This policy is the safest, but is more strict than most sites need since no
packages can be added without a reboot.
.It Cm create-backup
For package operations that require a reboot, a new boot environment is created
and set as active on the next boot.
If packages are modified or content that could affect the kernel is installed
and the operation affects the live boot environment, a backup boot environment
is created but not set as active.
A backup boot environment can also be explicitly requested.
.Pp
This policy is potentially risky only if newly installed software causes system
instability, which is possible but relatively rare.
.It Cm when-required
For package operations that require a reboot, a new boot environment is created
and set as active on the next boot.
A backup boot environment is not created unless explicitly requested.
.Pp
This policy carries the greatest risk since if a packaging change to the live
boot environment makes further changes impossible, there might be no recent
boot environment to which one can fallback.
.El
.It Cm ca-path
.Pq string
A path name that points to a directory where CA certificates are kept for SSL
operations.
The format of this directory is specific to the underlying SSL implementation.
To use an alternate location for trusted CA certificates, change this value to
point to a different directory.
See the
.Sy CApath
portions of
.Xr SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations 3openssl
for requirements for the CA directory.
.Pp
Default value:
.Pa /etc/ssl/certs
.It Cm check-certificate-revocation
.Sq boolean
If this is set to

the package client attempts to contact any CRL distribution points in the
certificates used for signature verification to determine whether the
certificate has been revoked since being issued.
.Pp
Default value:
.Sy False
.It Cm content-update-policy
.Pq string
Specify when the package system will update non-editable files during packaging
operations.
The following values are allowed:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm default
Always apply the default content update policy.
.It Cm always
Always download and update non-editable files that have changed.
.It Cm when-required
Download and update non-editable files that have changed only if the package
system has determined that an update is required.
.El
.Pp
Default value:
.Sy always
.It Cm default-recurse
.Pq boolean
If set to

the package client will default to recursing into child images for
.Nm Cm update
operations, as if the

This behaviour can be overriden on a per-case basis via the
.Fl R
option.
.Pp
Default value:
.Sy False
.It Cm exclude-patterns
.Pq string list
Any package delivering an action to a path which matches one of these patterns
is suppressed in the final execution plan.
The regular expression syntax used is that of Python.
For more information about Python regular expression syntax, use the command
.Sy pydoc re
or see more complete documentation at
.Lk http://docs.python.org/dev/howto/regex.html .
The regular expression is anchored at the beginning but not at the end,
therefore, a regular expression matching files by their extensions must include
a leading
.Ql .*
and should include a trailing
.Ql $ .
.Pp
Default value:
.Sy []
.Pq empty list
.\" exclude-policy
.It Cm exclude-policy
.Pq string
Determine what happens when an execution plan attempts to deliver an action to
an image when that action is excluded by the configured
.Cm exclude-patterns
property.
The following values are allowed:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm ignore
Ignore excluded actions; the actions will not be delivered to the image.
.It Cm warn
Display a warning message, listing each action which has not been delivered to
the image.
.It Cm reject
Reject the operation as an error, listing each action which matches the
configured image exclusions, and is therefore preventing the operation.
.El
.Pp
Default value:
.Cm warn .
.Pp
NB: The
.Sy sparse
brand installer sets this property to
.Cm reject
for sparse zone images.
.\" flush-content-cache-on-success
.It Cm flush-content-cache-on-success
.Pq boolean
If this is set to
.Sy True ,
the package client removes the files in its content-cache when image-modifying
operations complete successfully.
For operations that create a boot environment, the content will be removed from
both the source and destination boot environment.
.Pp
This property can be used to keep the content-cache small on systems with
limited disk space.
This property can cause operations to take longer to complete.
.Pp
Even when set to
.Sy False ,
the content cache can be manually cleaned up as required by running the
.Nm Cm clean

.It Cm key-files
.Pq string list
A list of files which must exist within the image for it to be considered
complete.
If any listed file is missing,
.Nm

.Pp
Default value:
.Sy []
.Pq empty list
.It Cm mirror-discovery
.Pq boolean
This property tells the client to discover link-local content mirrors using
mDNS and DNS-SD.
If this property is set to

the client attempts to download package content from mirrors it dynamically
discovers.
To run a mirror that advertises its content via mDNS, see the

.It Cm send-uuid
.Pq boolean
Send the image's Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) when performing network
operations.
Although users can disable this option, some network repositories might refuse
to talk to clients that do not supply a UUID.
.Pp
Default value:
.Sy True
.It Cm signature-policy
.Pq string
Determine what checks will be performed on manifests when installing, updating,
modifying, or verifying packages in the image.
The final policy applied to a package depends on the combination of image
policy and publisher policy.
The combination will be at least as strict as the stricter of the two policies
taken individually.
By default, the package client does not check whether certificates have been
revoked.
To enable those checks, which might require the client to contact external
Internet sites, set the
.Sy check-certificate-revocation
image property to
.Sy True
The following values are allowed:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm ignore
Ignore signatures for all manifests.
.It Cm verify
Verify that all manifests with signatures are validly signed, but do not
require all installed packages to be signed.
This is the default value.
.It Cm require-signatures
Require that all newly installed packages have at least one valid signature.
The
.Nm Cm fix
and
.Nm Cm verify
commands also warn if an installed package does not have a valid signature.
.It Cm require-names
Follow the same requirements as
.Cm require-signatures
but also require that the strings listed in the
.Sy signature-required-names
property appear as a common name of the certificates used to verify the chains
of trust of the signatures.
.El
.It Cm signature-required-names
.Pq list of strings
A list of names that must be seen as common names of certificates while
validating the signatures of a package.
.It Cm trust-anchor-directory
.Pq string
The path name of the directory that contains the trust anchors for the image.
This path is relative to the image.
.It Cm use-system-repo
.Pq boolean
This property indicates whether the image should use the system repository as a
source for image and publisher configuration and as a proxy for communicating
with the publishers provided.
The default value is
.Sy False .
.It Cm temp-be-activation
.Pq boolean
If set to
.Sy True
then, if a new boot environment is created as a result of the package
operation, and if it is activated, then that activation will be temporary -
that is, active for the next boot only - as if the
.Fl \-temp-be-activate
option had been provided on the command line.
